--Used OVER() and PARTITION BY clauses to segment subtotals by year, then ranked them within each year ASC and DESC to find the median for each year
select year(soh.orderdate) [OrderYear], min(soh.subtotal) minSubTotal, max(soh.subtotal) maxSubTotal,
avg(soh.subtotal) averageSubTotal, avg(x.subtotal) medianSubTotal
from sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
left join (
select subtotal, year(orderdate) yr, customerID,orderdate,salesorderid,
ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by year(orderdate) order by subtotal asc,salesorderid asc) as RowAsc,
ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by year(orderdate) order by subtotal desc,salesorderid desc) as RowDesc
from sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
) x
on year(soh.orderdate) = x.yr
where x.RowAsc in (x.RowDesc, x.RowDesc-1, x.RowDesc+1)
group by year(soh.orderdate)
order by [OrderYear]
